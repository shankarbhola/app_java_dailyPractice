Implement a Java program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit 
using functional interfaces. Define two functional interfaces, 
one for Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion and another for Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion. 
Implement these interfaces using lambda expressions and use them to convert temperatures as needed.
